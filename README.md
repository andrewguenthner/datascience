Data Science projects by Andrew Guenthner

This repository contains a collection of
projects spanning many years.

For older projects, full code is available
only by request from the US Navy or US Air
Force (if you're willing to wait a long 
time).  In some cases, I am building new
versions of the code that you can use to
reproduce the results.  Many of these
older projects were done with C, C++,
or Matlab.
